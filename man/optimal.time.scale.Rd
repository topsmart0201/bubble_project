\title{Best time-scale according to the approach by Watanabe et al. (2007a,b)}
\usage{
optimal.time.scale(xdat, maxlag = 10, min.win = 10, max.win = 20,
  n.replications = 2000, clust_number = 8, original = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{xdat}{is a T x 1 numeric data vector}

\item{maxlag}{is the maximum lag to be used to select the optimal AR lag order with AIC}

\item{min.win}{is the minimum window size to be tried during the simulations}

\item{max.win}{is the maximum window size to be tried during the simulations}

\item{n.replications}{is the number of simulated AR(p) processes (for each window size)}

\item{clust_number}{is the number of clusters for parallel computation}

\item{original}{if TRUE the original method by Watanabe et al. (2007a,b) is used, otherwise
a simplified approach which does not required nonlinear optimization.}

\description{
This function looks for the best time-scale according to the approach by Watanabe et al. (2007a,b)
}
\details{
This function looks for the best time-scale according to the approach by Watanabe et al. (2007a,b), using either the original method
or a simplified approach which does not required nonlinear optimization.
The optimal windown size according to Watanabe et al. (2007a,b) is the minimum window size for which always omega(i, Ti)<=1 holds.
If an estimated parameter omega(i,ti)>1, the following message is printed to the screen,
 "series is divergent, at least for one iteration = [", i, "],  omega(i,Ti) > 1"
 and the function stops checking further.
